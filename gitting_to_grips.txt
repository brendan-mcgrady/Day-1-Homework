To set up a (correct wording?) git:
- Use mkdir 'dir_name' to create a directory wherever you want to begin project (within appropriate directory; otherwise use cd 'child_dir_name' or cd ..(+/.. * num) to navigate to the desired child/parent directory).
- While in this directory, use 'git init' to initialise a git.
- Create files within the directory using 'touch x', or use 'mv' to move desired files from other directories as desired for new git project as necessary.
- Modify files as desired, then stage said changes using 'git add .' for all files in the directory or 'git add --' for individual files.
- When happy with changes completely, or when significant (small but reasonable in regularity) changes have been made, use 'git commit' to commit the staged changes to the repository - follow this with '-m "Comment relating to commit"' to append an easily readable, concise summation of commit's purpose.
- Go to Github, create a new repository with relevant name, and then c+p the command from browser to CLI to 'link' git to Github
- Any further commits can be pushed more simply thereafter using 'git push origin master'.

mkdir 'dir_name'
>> git init
>> touch x
>> git add ./git add --x
>> git commit -m "Comment"
>> create repo on Github, c+p command from browser to CLI
>> any commits thereafter, use 'git push origin master'

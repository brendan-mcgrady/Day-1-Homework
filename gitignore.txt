.gitignore will prevent any file types specified after the command (.gitignore *.txt, for one example, which = all .txt files) from being added to the repository.
This applies to whatever directory .gitignore is used in, as well as any child directory stemming from the original.
It can be overridden by using 'add .' or 'git add -f <file_name>' - the '-f' meaning 'force'.

I'll commit this file to Github as is, then will use .gitignore to ignore all .txt files within the homework_dir2, change it, then stage and commit again to see what happens.
Actually, pretty clueless.  Hopefully cover in class tomorrow and get better understanding.  Durr.
